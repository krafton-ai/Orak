# Slay The Spire Setup Guide

## 1. Install the Game and Modding Tool
- Download and install [Slay The Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) from Steam.
- From Slay the Spire Workshop in Steam, install "ModTheSpire", "BaseMod", "Unlock Everything" mods.
- Copy [ModifiedCommunicationMod.jar](../executables/slay_the_spire/ModifiedCommunicationMod.jar) to mod path. The mod path is typically located at:
    - Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\mods`

- Edit `config.properties` (this file is generated after starting game at least once with ModifiedCommunicationMod enabled).
    - Our evaluation and game processes communicate through file read/write operations. The configuration below specifies the path used for this communication.
