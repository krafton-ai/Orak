# Baba Is You Evaluation Guide

Before running the `mcp_play_game.py` script:

1. **Start the game manually.**
2. **Complete the tutorial level** ("Level 0") so that Level 1 becomes accessible.
3. **Navigate to Level 1**: `"where do i go?"`
4. **Move Baba at least once** (e.g., up and down) to trigger a game state update.  
   > This ensures that the mod script saves the initial state correctly.
5. Now you can run:
   ```bash
   uv run ./scripts/mcp_play_game.py --config ./src/mcp_agent_client/configs/baba_is_you/config.yaml
   ```
