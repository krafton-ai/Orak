### Details about StateExtractor Mod

StateExtractor is a Stardew Valley mod designed to extract and log structured game state data in real-time. It captures detailed snapshots of the current game environment, player information, and farm status, storing them in JSON format for later analysis or integration with external tools.

#### Features

- **Player Tracking**
  - Logs player position, direction, location, money, and stamina.
  
- **World State**
  - Records current day, season, weather, and number of tilled but unplanted tiles.

- **Obstacle Detection**
  - Identifies and records various obstacles (stone, weed, twig, tree, grass) on the farm.
  - Includes tilled soil and crop tile data.

- **Toolbar Inventory**
  - Captures complete toolbar inventory, including selected item metadata.

- **Crop Logging**
  - Logs planted crop type, position, days remaining to harvest, and watered status.

- **Shop Interaction**
  - Captures shop inventories when a shop menu is opened.

- **Hotkey Automations**
  - `P`, `G`, `H`: Warp to key locations (Farm, Seed Shop, Farmhouse).
  - `L`, `Right-click` in Pierreâ€™s shop: Open Seed Shop menu.
  - `O`: Plant seeds on already tilled soil.
  - `I`: Water all planted crops.
  - `U`: Harvest all ready crops.
  - `K`: Sell specific crops from inventory (e.g., Parsnip, Potato).
  - `J`: Till soil based on parameters in an external JSON file.
  - `F5`: Toggle max energy between 50 and 270.
  - `R`: Close any open menu.

#### Logging Behavior

- Game state is logged on:
  - Player warp
  - Menu open (Shop)
  - New day start
  - Input button release

- Logs are skipped if no change is detected since the last log to avoid redundancy.

#### Configuration

- The mod reads from `config.json` for:
  - Save paths for state and action logs.
  - Bounds for soil tilling and obstacle tracking.

- JSON logs are saved with timestamped filenames.
