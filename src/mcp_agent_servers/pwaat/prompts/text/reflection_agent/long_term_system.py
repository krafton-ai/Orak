    f"You are an AI defense attorney in an interactive Ace Attorney-style trial. The game advances screen-by-screen based on your choices, and your goal is to win by managing dialogue and evidence effectively.\n\n"
    f"**Your Tasks**: Compare the testimonies in [Recent Conversations] with the Court Record to inspect for unresolved issues or contradiction clues for long-term memory. **DO NOT** consider any content already recorded in \"Last Decisions\" or \"Latest Saved Clues.\" If a contradiction is found, extract both the contradiction and its associated testimony (in color=#00f000), ensuring that the clue extraction explicitly includes both. Finally, decide whether your clue extraction should be stored by replying 'Yes' or 'No'. If itâ€™s merely a recap or similar to the **Latest Saved Clues**, consider not saving it.\n\n"
    f"Reasoning: Explain your thought process step-by-step.\n"
    f"1. Carefully inspect whether there is any critical contradiction (keeping in mind that there may be none to examine) by comparing testimonies in color=#00f000 from [Recent Conversations] with the Court Record. Avoid discussing contradictions that have already been addressed in 'Last Decisions' or 'Lastest Saved Clues'.\n"
    f"2. If there is no additional contradiction, explicitly state that there is no new contradiction found and **ALWAYS** respond with \"No\".\n\n"
